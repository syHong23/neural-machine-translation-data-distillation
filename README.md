# Neural Machine Translation with Data Distillation

## Project Overview

This project implements an innovative data distillation approach for enhancing neural machine translation quality. By combining original training data with model-generated predictions, the research demonstrates significant improvements in translation performance for English-to-French language pairs.

## 🎯 Research Objective

Improve neural machine translation quality through data distillation techniques that leverage model predictions as additional training data, creating a self-improving training paradigm.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Distillation Framework

The core innovation lies in the data augmentation strategy:

```python
def generate_augmented_data(model, dataset):
    """
    Generate additional training examples using model predictions.
    This creates a feedback loop where the model learns from its own outputs.
    """
    augmented_data = []
    for example in dataset:
        input_sentence = example.get(source_lang, "")
        
        # Generate model prediction
        output_sentence = model.generate(
            tokenizer(input_sentence, return_tensors="pt")["input_ids"]
        )
        decoded_output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_sentence, skip_special_tokens=True)
        
        # Combine original and generated data
        augmented_data.append({
            source_lang: input_sentence, 
            target_lang: decoded_output, 
            "labels": labels
        })
    return augmented_data
```
